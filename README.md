# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
This project predicts house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using a linear regression model. The dataset was cleaned, visualized, and split into training and testing sets. Model performance was evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score. Sample inputs were also tested for real-world predictions. This basic model serves as a foundation for future improvements using more advanced regression or deep learning techniques.
